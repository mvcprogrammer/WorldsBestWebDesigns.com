Worlds Best Web Designs

This website is made from a web template. I sliced out the various sections and added them to controllers and views, using header, footer and menu as common files.
Next, I added SEO in the form of a request object handed to the view with SEO information specific to that page in the controller.
I believe this to be a simple, elegant design. More to come.
